== Sizing your image


=== Basic

The preferred way to set an image size that covers all output formats is:

----
image::flower.jpg[width="300",height="200",pdfwidth="100mm",scaledwidth="50%"]
----

height and width are for html. They are the size of the image file in pixels.
They do not change the displayed image size, instead they are used by the browser to reserve space when rendering (see http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#images).
The image size for asciidoctor-html is controlled automatically by the default stylesheet, which shows the image at its natural size or reduces it to fit if it is too large for the current window.

+pdfwidth+ applies to asciidoctor-pdf only (see https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf#image-scaling).

+scaledwidth+ applies to asciidoctor-fopub only, and sizes the image as a percentage of the page width (margin to margin).

=== Advanced

You can size images in other ways, but the attributes you need depend on the backend:

.Image sizing methods
|====
|Backend |Absolute |Relative to original image size |Relative to "page" width

|asciidoctor (html)
|width="120" BUG (also automatic scaled by stylesheet)
|Not possible
|width="80%" (also automatic scaled by stylesheet)

|asciidoctor-pdf
|pdfwidth="100mm" (or mm, cm, in, px, or pt) BUG
|pdfwidth="80%" BUG
|pdfwidth="60vw" BUG

|asciidoctor-fopub (pdf)
|width="100mm" (or mm, cm, in, em, pc or pt)
|width="80%"
|scaledwidth="80%"

|====

You can make a single source file suitable for all backends by defining attributes:

----
\ifdef::html[]
:not-sized:
:twoinches: width="144"
:full-width: width="100%"
:half-width: width="50%"
:half-size:
:thumbnail: width="60"
\endif::[]
\ifdef::pdf[]
:not-sized:
:twoinches: pdfwidth="2in"
:full-width: pdfwidth="100vw"
:half-width: pdfwidth="50vw"
:half-size: pdfwidth="50%"
:thumbnail: pdfwidth="20mm"
\endif::[]
\ifdef::docbook[]
:not-sized:
:twoinches: width="50mm"
:full-width: scaledwidth="100%"
:half-width: scaledwidth="50%"
:half-size: width="50%"
:thumbnail: width="20mm"
\endif::[]
----

Then specify your images as:

----
image::image.jpg[title="Title", {half-size}]
----

and setting the appropriate attribute from the command line when yoy convert the document:

----
include::convert.sh[]
----

NOTE: The way image sizes are specified may be changing (http://discuss.asciidoctor.org/Unit-of-measure-for-image-dimensions-td3040.html#a3222). 
Attributes are good way to future-proof your document.

== Examples

image::fox.jpg[title="not-sized - {not-sized}", {not-sized}]

image::fox.jpg[title="twoinches - {twoinches}", {twoinches}]

image::fox.jpg[title="half-size - {half-size}", {half-size}]

image::fox.jpg[title="full-width - {full-width}", {full-width}]

image::fox.jpg[title="half-width - {half-width}", {half-width}]

image::fox.jpg[title="thumbnail - {thumbnail}", {thumbnail}]

== Experiment

Tested with:

* asciidoctor 1.5.5

* asciidoctor-pdf 1.5.0.alpha.6

* asciidoctor-fopub SNAPSHOT 2016-11-20

* Firefox 49.0.2

* Ubuntu 15 Document Viewer

=== asciidoctor html

Raw comes out as native image size. (GOOD)

Autoscaling applies if the image is too big to fit the window. (GOOD)

Otherwise, always obeys width attribute (BUG - should be ignored)

width% = fraction of screen width. (GOOD, but not allowed in html5)

width is copied straight to the html width attribute.

=== asciidoctor-pdf

Raw is scaled to fit on the page (GOOD)

pdfwidth is ignored. (BUG)

scaledwidth is applied correctly. (GOOD? Not documented, but code seems to treat it as a fallback if pdfwidth is not defined)

width% scales images (GOOD)

width all other units get interpreted as ? (bit bigger than a pt) (BUG - should be implemented)

=== asciidoc-fopub

Raw is not resized - may exceed page width. (GOOD? Not documented)

Responds to width and scaledwidth, width has priority. (GOOD? Not documented)

width=50% is relative to image size. (GOOD? Not documented)

scaledwidth=50% is relative to page width. (GOOD)

width=60 becomes contentwidth=60

height=40 becomes contentheight=40

scaledwidth=50% becomes width=50%, scalefit=1
